## JavaScript Tool Box
Key tools you will need to work effectively and efficiently with JavaScript, as you embark on building cool applications.

Here's a list of industry-recommended and trending tools you'll need in your toolbox:
* **VS (Visual Studio) Code** - Microsoft's very own lightweight and powerful code editor, built using, none other than JavaScript.
* **ESLint** - Linting extension (package tool) for finding and fixing JS Code.
* **Prettier** - Formatting extension (package tool) for automatically formatting your JS code.
* **JavaScript ES6 Code Snippets** - Extension for shortcuts to most-used code fragements (keywords and constrcuts). This tool can help you save time.
* **Node.JS** - A server-side "runtime environment" for running JavaScript code outside of the browser.
* **NVM (Node Version Management)** - A tool for installing and updating Node.js. The JS and Node ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly - this tool ensures that your node version and installation is always kept up-to-date and can also manage node on multiple environments (windows, linux and mac).
