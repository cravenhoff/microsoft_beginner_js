## JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript is a "weakly" or **loosely-type language**. It differs from strongly-type languages such as C# or Java.

This means that variables declared in JavaScript do not require their values to be explicitly defined. JavaScript will automatically work out their data type. Furthermore, when dealing with different types of data in arithmetic operations, JavaScript will try to convert one data type to another so that a common denominator can be determined, allowing the arithmetic operation to be executed.

There are 7 different data types in JavaScript:
* **Number** - JavaScript does not differentiate between floats and integers. However, by default, all numbers are treated as floats.
* **BigInt** - For integers values larger than (253-1) (thatâ€™s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
* **String** - Literal or text characters.
* **Boolean** - True (1) or False (0) values.
* **Array** - A type of "object" data type that can store multiple values, called **elements**.
* **Object** - A composite data type containing properties and methods (functions).
* **Function** - Mini-programs and code blocks for reusable code / snippets.
