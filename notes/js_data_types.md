## JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript is a "weakly" or "loosely-type" language. It differs from strongly-type languages such as C# or Java.

This means that variables declared in JavaScript do not require their values to be explicitly defined. JavaScript will automatically work out their data type. Furthermore, when dealing with different types of data in arithmetic operations, JavaScript will try to convert one data type to another so that a common denominator can be determined, allowing the arithmetic operation to be executed.
