## Mathematics in JavaScript
JavaScript can perform various mathematical operations including the common arithmetic operators, as well as complex math operations like trigonometry, logarithms and more.

### Arithmetic Operators
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)

Examples:

    const num1 = 9;
    const num2 = 3;

    /* ADDITION */
    num1 + num1; // returns a new value containing the sum of 9 and 3 === 12.
    
    /* SUBTRACTION */
    num1 - num2; // subtracts 9 from 3 and returns a new value === 6.
    
    /* MULTIPLICATION */
    num1 * num2; // returns a new value containing the product of 9 and 3 === 27.
    
    /* DIVISION */
    num1 / num2; // divides 9 by 3 and returns a new value === 3.
