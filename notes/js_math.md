## Mathematics in JavaScript
JavaScript can perform various mathematical operations including the common arithmetic operators, as well as complex math operations like trigonometry, logarithms and more.

### Arithmetic Operators
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)

Examples:

    const num1 = 9;
    const num2 = 3;

    /* ADDITION */
    num1 + num1; // returns a new value containing the sum of 9 and 3 === 12.
    
    /* SUBTRACTION */
    num1 - num2; // subtracts 9 from 3 and returns a new value === 6.
    
    /* MULTIPLICATION */
    num1 * num2; // returns a new value containing the product of 9 and 3 === 27.
    
    /* DIVISION */
    num1 / num2; // divides 9 by 3 and returns a new value === 3.

### Special Math Operations
JavaScript also provides the following special mathematics operations:
* Modulus (%) - Returns the remainder of a division operation.
* Increment (++) - Increments or adds one to a value.
* Decrement (--) - Decrements or removes one from a value.

Examples:

    let int1 = 10;
    let int2 = 2;
    
    /* MODULUS */
    int1 % int2; // returns the remainder 0.
    
    /* INCREMENT AND DECREMENT */
    int1++; // int1 is now === 11.
    int2--; // int2 is now === 1.

### Math Object
JavaScript can perform even more complex mathematical operations using the Math Object.

Here are the common mathematical operations that can be performed using the Math Object.
* `Math.PI` - Returns the PI Constant `3.141592653589793`.
* `Math.sqrt()` - Returns the square root of a number.
