## JavaScript Variables

Variables in JavaScript are "storage containers" for holding different types of data, from simple values such as strings and numbers to complex data types in the form of functions and objects.

There are three different ways to create variables in JavaScript, each of which are handled differently.

### Var Keyword
The "var" keyword is the oldest and original method for variable creation. It has been in use since the initial days of JavaScript.

Following are three key things about the **var** keyword:
* Function scoped - Available within a function's scope
* Can be changes in scope - A mutable variable type.
* Available before declaration - Can be declared on line 10 but will still be available on line 1 within the function.
