## Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a C-based compiled and JIT (Just-In-Time) language that is used to develop powerful and highly interactive front-end and back-end web applications.

JavaScript has been around for 25 years and has evolved rapidly over just the last 10 years into a language that has moved beyond just its ability to manipulte browser-based HTML elements, to one that can now develop scalable, high-performing desktop applications and fully native apps (Electron and MeteorJS).
