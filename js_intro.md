## Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a C-based compiled and JIT (Just-In-Time) language that is used to develop powerful and highly interactive front-end and back-end web applications.

JavaScript has been around for 25 years and has evolved rapidly over just the last 10 years into a language that has moved beyond just its ability to manipulte browser-based HTML elements, to one that can now develop scalable, high-performing desktop applications and fully native apps (Electron and MeteorJS).


## JavaScript Browser vs. JavaScript Server
JavaScript has evoled beyond just its ability to interact with web pages and manipulate HTML elements.

JavaScript in the browser encompasses what is called "front-end development". In front-end development, JavaScript is used to apply interactivitiy to a web page's HTML elements. This is done through the Document Object Model, mostly referred to as the DOM.
