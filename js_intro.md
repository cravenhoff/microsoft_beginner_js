## Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a C-based compiled and JIT (Just-In-Time) language that is used to develop powerful and highly interactive front-end and back-end web applications.

JavaScript has been around for 25 years and has evolved rapidly over just the last 10 years into a language that has moved beyond just its ability to manipulte browser-based HTML elements, to one that can now develop scalable, high-performing desktop applications and fully native apps (Electron and MeteorJS).


## JavaScript Browser vs. JavaScript Server
JavaScript has evoled beyond just its ability to interact with web pages and manipulate HTML elements.

JavaScript in the browser encompasses what is called "front-end development". In front-end development, JavaScript is used to apply interactivitiy to a web page's HTML elements. This is done through the Document Object Model, mostly referred to as the DOM.

On the other hand, JavaScript now has the capability to run outside of the browser, using a runtime environment called "Node" or Node.js. Because JavaScript now does not run in the browser, it does not have access to the DOM. This means that there's little to nothing JavaScript can do in Node to interact with and manipulate the DOM (Elements of a web page). However, there's a lot of possibilities that open up when JavaScript is used in Node.

Development using JavaScript outside the browser, is JavaScript in the Server. This type of development is known as "back-end development". JavaScript back-end development or "server-side programming" generally involves the development of programming logic that processes server-side operations such as making API calls to external web services, connecting to a databse, connecting to a server, and yes, even creating a server. It is these array of capabilities in server-side programming that really bring out the dynamic and versatility of JavaScript.
