# Beginner's Series to JavaScript: Microsoft Developer
A 51-Beginner Series to JavaScript developed and delivered by Microsoft. Check out tutorial at: https://youtu.be/_EDM5aPVLmo.

This repo is a collection of notes and code snippets I've compiled while going through the tutorial. I mostly used this beginner series guide to supplement the Switch Maven Software Development Bootcamp Course on Full-Stack Web Development.
